## About Dataset
Over 9,000 images of sports balls from 15 different sports. These are: american football, baseball, basketball, billiard ball, bowling ball, cricket ball, football, golf ball, field hockey ball, hockey puck, rugby ball, shuttlecock, table tennis ball, tennis ball and volleyball.

Images were scraped from google images and then manually reviewed to remove misclassified images (although I might have missed some). Duplicates were removed using a dHash style algorithm. The train/test split is 80/20.

This is an interesting dataset because several images are misleading, e.g. some balls have been painted to look like other balls. See some examples below:
